# AutoScroll v2.0
Small fun program intended to be used as an alternative environment to read your reading material (article, pdf, poems, stories, etc) without the need to scroll manually along with the extra settings to adjust your scrolling speed and font size.

Last update:
> Added a proper UI to differentiate distinct sections/panels
> Added a cookie to store user's dark mode value
> Added a clear button to clear the read section

Future updates:
> Adding a pause functionality
> Rebuilding scroll by function for smoother effect regardless of speed/font-size
> More controls (read section height adjustment, etc)
