# AutoScroll

### Project Description
A small project intended to help those that may want a bit of control over how they consume their reading material. With simplicity in mind, our reading environment will always try to balance user-friendliness, configuration, and customization as best as possible. The main focus of this project is to eliminate the manual approach of scrolling within a site, article, manual, etc. AutoScroll gives users the ability to configure and optimize their reading experience to match their needs.
