# AutoScroll

### Project Description
A small project intended to help those that may want a bit of control over how they consume their reading material. With simplicity in mind, our reading environment will always try to balance user-friendliness, configuration, and customization as best as possible. The main focus of this project is to eliminate the manual approach of scrolling within a site, article, manual, etc. AutoScroll gives users the ability to configure and optimize their reading experience to match their needs.

## How do I use AutoScroll?

#### Step 1:
Visit the website: [AutoScroll](https://norblit.github.io/AutoScroll/)
#### Step 2:
Copy the text you plan to read from either an article, document, post, etc and paste it into the text input, and then click submit. You'll notice your reading material was taken to the reading prompt down below.
#### Step 3: 
From there, you will have access to the control panel where you can configure your ideal settings such as font-size, scroll speed and also a set of playback buttons (we are currently adding more so please keep that in mind).
#### Step 4: 
Once you're ready to read, click the green start button and that's it!
